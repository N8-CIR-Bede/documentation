CMake
=====

`CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
The suite of CMake tools were created by `Kitware <https://www.kitware.com/>`__ in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

CMake is part of Kitwareâ€™s collection of commercially supported `open-source platforms <https://www.kitware.com/platforms/>`__ for software development.

        On ``aarch64`` nodes, CMake ``3.20.2`` is provided by default.

This provides the ``cmake``, ``ccmake``, ``cpack`` and ``ctest`` binaries are available for use, to configure, build and test software which uses CMake as the build system.
